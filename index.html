                            <p><b>Energy efficiency</b> is the first fuel and must be at the core of our nation’s energy policy. Energy efficiency is not a sideshow. It is the main show, and we’ve only begun to tap it. To achieve it, there are dozens of things you can do, many of them strictly personal and cost-effective as well. You have to know which kind of lightbulb to get. Can you install a ground source heat pump? What about tightening the walls of your home to reduce air leakage, thereby saving on heating and cooling your home? Your landlord may be choosing what equipment to put in, but since he might not pay the energy bill, he might not care how efficient it is.
                                You can also try to influence legislation to enact energy-efficiency policies. One such policy is the carbon cap. Current proposals are to set a limit on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions by issuing permits that limit those emissions to entities like power and industrial plants. These plants would be allowed to trade permits among themselves in a system known as cap-and-trade. By one independent estimate, a carbon cap bill would take energy demand—predicted to go up 15 percent over the next 40 years—and essentially hold it flat. Another policy would address building-energy codes. Buildings account for about two-fifths of the energy we use and are responsible for about two-fifths of the carbon emitted in this country. Right now building codes tend to say OK, can we get 1 percent, can we get 2 percent savings maybe? No, we need 30 percent savings. That’s a starting point. Then 50 percent savings, then more moving forward from that point.</p>
